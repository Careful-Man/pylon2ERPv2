# Pylon2ERP v2.0

COMMERCIAL PROJECT

This program was developed on behalf of Afroditi S.A. It bridges the firms' payroll and ERP system. It reads .txt files
that the payroll program produces, that are payroll articles and resolves the general ledger accounts so that they match 
with the firms' erp system. It shows all actions it performs to a console like text area. After it has read the files 
specified, it exports a single .txt file that can be imported to the ERP system, massively registering the articles.
